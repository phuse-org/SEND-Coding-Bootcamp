This is the general concept of a `for` loop, for each _element_ in a _collection_ do something to that _element_.  In our example above, the statment `for char in word` for each _element_ (letter) in our _collection_ (word) assign it to the variable `char`.  This allows us to treat `char` like we would any other variable in python, with the difference being that `char` will take on a different value through each element of our collection.

    "So how many times does the code within the `for` loop execute?  The answer is however many elements are in whatever we are using the `for` loop to iterate through.  In the case above that would be 5, because their are 5 elements in our string `'aeiou'`.  Why did the variable `length` display a value of 5 when we assigned it a value of 0?  Before the `for` loop executes we a assign it a value it a value of 0.  However, the expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "length = length + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "is assigning a new value to length through each iteration of the `for` loop; where the new value is the old value + 1.  After the first iteration of the `for` loop, `length` would be equal to 1 (0 = 0 + 1).  Through the second iteration, it would be 2 (2 = 1 + 1). Through the third, 3 (3 = 2 + 1); And so on throughout the length of the string `aeiou`.  Which would leave us with the number 5.  It's important to remember that even though the variable `vowel` isn't being used within the `for` loop, it is still taking on the value of each element we are iterating over.  And it doesn't go after the `for` loop is over.  "
