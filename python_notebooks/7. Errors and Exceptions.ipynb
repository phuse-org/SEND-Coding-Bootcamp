    "# Errors and Exceptions \n",
    "\n",
    "Every programmer encounters errors, both those who are just beginning, and those who have been programming for years. Encountering errors and exceptions can be very frustrating at times, and can make coding feel like a hopeless endeavour. However, understanding what the different types of errors are and when you are likely to encounter them can help a lot. Once you know why you get certain types of errors, they become much easier to fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors in Python have a very specific form, called a traceback. Let’s examine one:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import errors_01\n",
    "errors_01.favorite_ice_cream()\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "<ipython-input-1-9d0462a5b07c> in <module>()\n",
    "      1 import errors_01\n",
    "----> 2 errors_01.favorite_ice_cream()\n",
    "\n",
    "/Users/jhamrick/project/swc/novice/python/errors_01.pyc in favorite_ice_cream()\n",
    "      5         \"strawberry\"\n",
    "      6     ]\n",
    "----> 7     print(ice_creams[3])\n",
    "\n",
    "IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "```\n",
    "This particular traceback has two levels. You can determine the number of levels by looking for the number of arrows on the left hand side. In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first shows code from the cell above, with an arrow pointing to Line 2 (which is `favorite_ice_cream()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second shows some code in another function (`favorite_ice_cream()`, located in the file `errors_01.py`), with an arrow pointing to Line 7 (which is `print(ice_creams[3])`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The last level is the actual place where the error occurred. The other level(s) show what function the program executed to get to the next level down. So, in this case, the program first performed a function call to the function favorite_ice_cream. Inside this function, the program encountered an error on Line 7, when it tried to run the code `print(ice_creams[3])`."

    "## Long Tracebacks ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you might see a traceback that is very long – sometimes they might even be 20 levels deep! This can make it seem like something horrible happened, but really it just means that your program called many functions before it ran into the error. Most of the time, you can just pay attention to the bottom-most level, which is the actual place where the error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what error did the program actually encounter? In the last line of the traceback, Python helpfully tells us the category or type of error (in this case, it is an IndexError) and a more detailed error message (in this case, it says “list index out of range”).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter an error and don’t know what it means, it is still important to read the traceback closely. That way, if you fix the error, but encounter a new one, you can tell that the error changed. Additionally, sometimes just knowing where the error occurred is enough to fix it, even if you don’t entirely understand the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do encounter an error you don’t recognize, try looking at the official documentation on errors. However, note that you may not always be able to find the error there, as it is possible to create custom errors. In that case, hopefully the custom error message is informative enough to help you figure out what went wrong."

    "## Syntax Errors ##\n",
    "\n",
    "When you forget a colon at the end of a line, accidentally add one space too many when indenting under an if statement, or forget a parenthesis, you will encounter a syntax error. This means that Python couldn’t figure out how to read your program. This is similar to forgetting punctuation in English: for example, this text is difficult to read there is no punctuation there is also no capitalization why is this hard because you have to figure out where each sentence ends you also have to figure out where each sentence begins to some extent it might be ambiguous if there should be a sentence break or not\n",
    "\n",
    "People can typically figure out what is meant by text with no punctuation, but people are much smarter than computers. If Python doesn’t know how to read the program, it will just give up and inform you with an error. For example:"
