# PDS SEND Anonymized Data Set

The Xpt folder contains an anonymized SEND data set that has been successfully run through the FDA’s validation process. The anonymized data set is for a one-month GLP rat toxicity study with recovery. It contains “pool” data for food consumption, as animals were group housed. The .xpt files included in the file set are `BG`, `BW`, `CL`, `CO`, `DM`, `EX`, `FW`, `LB`, `MA`, `MI`, `OM`, `PC`, `POOLDEF`, `PP`, `RELREC`, `SC`, `SE`, `SUPPMA`, `SUPPMI`, `SUPPPP`, `TA`, `TE`, `TS`, `TX`. The define.pdf and define.xml files are also
included.
The data set is an example of an “inter-organizational SEND” data set, with multiple LIMS data sources compiled into a single, harmonized file set. The data types were provided from the following systems:

* Toxicology – Third-party toxicology system
* Clinical Pathology – Third-party system
* Pathology – PDS PathData™
* Pharmacokinetics – Watson LIMS™

To view the .xpt files, one must use a SAS viewer. If you do not have a SAS viewer installed, please install one of the SAS viewers from the links below:

* [SAS Universal Viewer](http://support.sas.com/software/products/univiewer/index.html "SAS Universal Viewer")
* [SAS Universal Viewer 9.3](http://support.sas.com/demosdownloads/sysdep_t1.jsp?packageID=878&context=%2Fdownloads "SAS Universal Viewer 9.3")

Note: Older versions of SAS Universal Viewer (formerly SAS System Viewer) may behave
differently and are not recommended.<br><br>
