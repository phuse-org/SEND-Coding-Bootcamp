These SEND datasets and the associated define.xml were developed by the CDISC SEND Safety Pharmacology team as part of a proof-of-concept (POC) pilot with the FDA to determine a) if they can be loaded into the FDA's reviewer tools and b) if they can be used to create tables and graphs suitable for reviewers. This review is a work in progress, and datsets and associated define.xml are subject to change at any time.  CDISC makes no claim that these files are currently correct or complete.

These datasets follow the CDISC SENDIG 3.1 standard.  

Note that a latin square study design has been utilized, where each animal gets all of the dose levels on the study in a particular sequence, and data are summarized for analysis based on the dose level administered at the start of each study period.  The ELEMENT contains the dose level administered, and the Subject Elements (SE) identifies the dose level given to each animal during each period, as well as the start and end of the period.
