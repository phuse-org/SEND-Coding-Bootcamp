# SEND-Coding-Bootcamp

### Overview 
The three-day SEND Coding Bootcamp aims to help those work with SEND datasets become more productive by teaching basic coding and plotting skills.

Over the course of three seperate hands-on coding workshop, participants will learn the basics of programming and plotting using the R programming language. The course will be oriented around SEND datasets and will including reading, writing, plotting, and manipulating SEND datasets stored in .xpt format.

### Audience 

This workshop is aimed at those work with SEND datasets, so basic knowledge of the SEND standard is expected.  No previous knowledge about programming or the R programming language is needed.  

### Dates

The workshop will take place on three seperate sessions and will build on knowledge learned from prior lessons.  The general outline of the course is as follows (but subject to change). 

* Day 1: Introduction to R Programming 
* Day 2: Basic Plotting with R 
* Day 3: Advance Plotting using ggplot
* Day 4: Data analysis using the tidyverse

### Software installation

The course will be taught using the cloud-based computing environment on [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/).  Posit Cloud hosts R environments in a remote, cloud-based setting eliminating the need for the downloading and installation of software onto attendee's computer.  Getting set up in the Posit Cloud will be done during the first session, users are expected to create an account prior to the first day.
